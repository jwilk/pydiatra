[assertion-always-true]
severity = minor
certainty = certain
description =
 It's a common error to write code like this::
 .
 .    assert(x > 0, "x must be positive")  # wrong!
 .
 The intention was to check whether ``x > 0`` is true.
 But this code checks if the tuple is true,
 and it always is, regardless of the value of ``x``.
 The correct code omits the parentheses::
 .
 .    assert x > 0, "x must be positive"

description =
 It's a common error to write code like this::
 .
 .    try:
 .        ...
 .    except TypeError, ValueError:  # wrong!
 .        ...
 .
 The intention was to catch both ``TypeError`` and ``ValueError`` exceptions,
 but this code does something different: it will catch ``TypeError``
 and bind the resulting exception object to the local name ``ValueError``.
 The ``ValueError`` exception will not be caught at all.
 The correct code specifies a tuple of exceptions::
 .
 .    try:
 .        ...
 .    except (TypeError, ValueError):
 .        ...

 The source file mixes tabs and spaces for indentation in a way that makes it

 You can check consistency of indentation with the following command::
