[assertion-always-true]
severity = minor
certainty = certain
references =
 https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-assert_stmt
description =
 It's a mistake to write code like this::
 .
 .    assert(x > 0, "x must be positive")  # wrong!
 .
 The intention was to check whether ``x > 0`` is true.
 But this code checks if the tuple is true,
 and it always is, regardless of the value of ``x``.
 The correct code omits the parentheses::
 .
 .    assert x > 0, "x must be positive"

[embedded-code-copy]
severity = important
certainty = possible
references =

description =
 The source appears to include
 a convenience copy of code from other software package.

[except-shadows-builtin]
severity = important
certainty = possible
references =
 https://docs.python.org/2/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-3110-exception-handling-changes
description =
 It's a mistake to write code like this::
 .
 .    try:
 .        ...
 .    except TypeError, ValueError:  # wrong!
 .        ...
 .
 The intention was to catch both ``TypeError`` and ``ValueError`` exceptions,
 but this code does something different: it will catch ``TypeError``
 and bind the resulting exception object to the local name ``ValueError``.
 The ``ValueError`` exception will not be caught at all.
 The correct code specifies a tuple of exceptions::
 .
 .    try:
 .        ...
 .    except (TypeError, ValueError):
 .        ...

[bare-except]
severity = minor
certainty = possible
experimental = yes
references =
 https://docs.python.org/2/howto/doanddont.html#except
description =
 It's a mistake to write code like this::
 .
 .    try:
 .        ...
 .    except:  # wrong!
 .        ...
 .
 The ``except:`` clause catches all the exceptions,
 including exceptions that the programmer never expected to happen,
 potentially hiding programming errors,
 or ignoring ``KeyboardInterrupt`` triggered by user's Ctrl+C.
 .
 Please catch only the exceptions you expect to be raised.

description =
 It's a mistake to write code like this::
 .
 .    try:
 .        ...
 .    except OSError as exc:
 .        if e.errno == 17:  # non-portable!
 .           ...
 .
 The code was meant to check for ``EEXIST``,
 but actaul value of this constant may vary with architecture.
 The portable code uses constant from the ``errno`` module::
 .
 .    try:
 .        ...
 .    except OSError as exc:
 .        if e.errno == errno.EEXIST:
 .           ...

[inconsistent-use-of-tabs-and-spaces-in-indentation]
severity = normal
certainty = certain
references =
 https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#indentation
description =
 The source file mixes tabs and spaces for indentation in a way that makes it
 depend on the worth of a tab expressed in spaces.
 .
 You can check consistency of indentation with the following command::
 .
 .    python -m tabnanny <pyfile>

[mkstemp-file-descriptor-leak]
severity = normal
certainty = possible
description =
 ``tempfile.mkstemp()`` returns a tuple containing
 a file descriptor and the pathname.
 It is reponsiblity of the caller to close the file descriptor
 when it's no longer needed.
 It's a mistake to write code like this::
 .
 .    path = tempfile.mkstemp()[1]
 .
 because it leaks the file descriptor.
 .
 Please consider using a higher-level function instead,
 ``tempfile.TemporaryFile()`` or ``tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()``,
 which take care of file closing automatically.

[regexp-duplicate-range]
severity = minor
certainty = possible
description =
 A character set in a regular expression includes
 the same character range twice.
 This is probably a mistake.
 .
 For example::
 .
 .    [A-ZA-Z]
 .
 could be simplified to::
 .
 .    [A-Z]

[regexp-overlapping-ranges]
severity = important
certainty = possible
description =
 A character set in a regular expression includes
 two intersecting character ranges.
 This is probably a mistake.
 .
 For example::
 .
 .    [A-za-z]
 .
 is a common misspelling of::
 .
 .    [A-Za-z]

description =
 The code attempts to raise or catch strings exceptions.

 String exceptions have been removed in Python 2.6.
 Attempting to raise them causes ``TypeError``.

 in a way that always causes runtime error.
